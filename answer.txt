2.What does fast-forward in Git mean?
- If we want to merge two branches in the graph structure and both the branches are in same commit path and both are not divergent branches then we can simply merge them by moving one branch pointer forward to other branch which is caertain commits ahead of it in same commit path. That is called fast-forward in Git.

- branches help us organize the workflow of the system more efficiently and effortlessly. If group of 6 people building a software for a company or making a project, It would be a better idea to have a branch for each developer because usually they work on different things. And as Git provides facility of branching, one can keep working on his/her branch regardless of the work that is happening in other branches.
